    <h1><b>Our Project Scheme</b></h1>

    <p><i>Noah & Adam</i></p>

    <h2>JumpShoot: Rise of the Big Chungus.</h2>

    <p><i>Description:</i></p>

    <p>The objective is to make a two-player jumping game using java. 
    There will be multiple platforms that players can jump on to avoid 
    being brutally shot by one another. The player's job is to not be a failure 
    and lose all three of their lives. Whoever survives is the winner.</p>
	<h2>Player Movement</h2>
	<p>Movement will be controlled by 4 keys (e.g. the WASD keys).
	The up key will cause the player to jump. Jumping is currently only allowed if the player
	is on a platform, however we hope to add double jumping as a feature. Longer key presses
	of the jump key will result in higher jumps. The left and right keys will cause the player to
	move in that direction at a constant speed while they are pressed down, even if the player is in
	the air. The down key will cause the player to accelerate downwards faster than normal.</p>
	
	<h2>Shooting</h2>
	<p>There will be one or multiple balls in play. The balls can be in two different states,
	dangerous and pickupable. The default state of a ball is pickupable.
	If a ball is pickupable, a player can press a key to pick it up. Players
	can only hold one ball at a time. If a player has a ball, they can shoot/throw it.
	A ball is dangerous after a player throws it until it hits a wall. It then
	becomes pickupable. If a player comes into contact with a dangerous ball, they lose a life.
	A player dies when all their lives are gone.
	
	<h2>Fun Stuff</h2>
	<p>We anticipate making the balls look like rabbit (Chungus) heads.</p>
