Weird glitch where you can throw a ball into the corner and it will fall through the floor

Don't need id_to_name in server.js, can just store the player name in the io.on("connection") scope
And don't need to keep track of connected / disconnected in a player status
- oh wait I remember why we did this - to prevent more than one connection at a time from accessing / being a certain player
- feels like there might be some way to hack this hmm




DONE

Should really have the time synchronized via linux timestamps

All keypresses need to be timestamped, and calculations done based on this, to stop weird glitchiness
- this is because if you let go of the key between updates, the server
assumes you didn't move at all since the last update, when in fact you
were moving for part of the update
