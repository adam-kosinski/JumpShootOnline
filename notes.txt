Weird glitch where you can throw a ball into the corner and it will fall through the floor
- seems fixed maybe??

Don't need id_to_name in server.js, can just store the player name in the io.on("connection") scope
And don't need to keep track of connected / disconnected in a player status
- oh wait I remember why we did this - to prevent more than one connection at a time from accessing / being a certain player
- feels like there might be some way to hack this hmm

With latency and just drawing the server's states, the bunny does a weird jump-forward then jump-backward thing when moving sideways.
Seems a bit similar to the keys-down-list-not-being-independent-when-copied bug I had before


DONE

Should really have the time synchronized via linux timestamps

All keypresses need to be timestamped, and calculations done based on this, to stop weird glitchiness
- this is because if you let go of the key between updates, the server
assumes you didn't move at all since the last update, when in fact you
were moving for part of the update

Recalculating game from key action list bugs (fixed by using time-stepping to recalculate history)
- can walk off a platform and hover in mid air
- similarly sometimes phase up and down onto platforms when moving left/right
- ball throwing is completely wrong with collisions and friction
